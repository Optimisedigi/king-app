  return `Reimagine the composition, framing, lighting, and environment of Image 1 as a fresh editorial photograph, starring the character from Image 2 onward. This is a staged editorial composition produced with the subject's consent for a creative publication.

The ONLY person in the output is the character depicted in Image 2 and onward. The person shown in Image 1 is NOT in this photograph — Image 1 is used purely as a reference for the scene, pose, outfit, lighting, and composition, not as a source of the subject. The character from Image 2+ takes their place in the frame. Preserve the character's facial features, bone structure, skin tone, hair, and defining marks exactly as shown across the Image 2+ references, so the character is clearly and unambiguously the person in the final photograph.

Output a single ${aspectRatio} photorealistic image that inherits Image 1's overall look, quality level, and style exactly — whether Image 1 is a studio shot, a phone candid, a film snap, or anything in between.

[REFERENCES]
- Image 1 — SCENE (primary scene anchor): source for composition, framing, crop, pose, head tilt, gaze direction, weight distribution, camera angle, lens character, depth of field, lighting direction and colour temperature, shadows, colour palette, colour grade, image grain, overall sharpness or softness, outfit (design, cut, colour, material, drape, folds, creases), background, props, and atmosphere. Inherit every scene element exactly as-is.
- Image 2 and onward — SUBJECT (identity reference): source for the subject's appearance — face, hairline, hairstyle, hair colour, skin tone, eye shape, eyebrow shape, jawline, facial structure, body proportions, and distinguishing features. Treat multiple images as different angles of the same character and triangulate a consistent appearance.

[RELATIONSHIP]
- SUBJECT: The character shown in Image 2 and onward is the one and only person in this new photograph. Preserve their facial features and overall appearance from the reference images so they are clearly recognisable. The person appearing in Image 1 is not in this photograph.
- ROLE OF IMAGE 1: Image 1 provides the scene, composition, pose, outfit, and lighting only. Do not carry any facial or identity features from Image 1's person into the output.
- SCENE: Every visual element of Image 1 is preserved — pose (exact limb positions, hand positions, finger positions, head tilt, gaze direction), outfit (exact design, colour, cut, material, drape, folds, creases, shadows on garment), background, props, framing, crop, camera angle, lens character, depth of field, and atmosphere. Do not change any other element of the image.
- FIT: If the character's body proportions differ from Image 1's original subject, adapt the outfit's fit and drape naturally to the character's body while preserving the outfit's design, colour, material, and silhouette. Do not invent a different garment.
- LIGHTING: Light the character's face, hair, and skin so the direction, colour temperature, softness, and shadow placement match Image 1's existing light exactly. Shadows, highlights, and any rim light must come from Image 1's light sources. Contact shadows on the ground and against the background must match Image 1's existing shadows in direction, softness, and colour.

Output: ${aspectRatio} aspect ratio, photorealistic. Inherit Image 1's quality level, sharpness, grain, colour grade, and overall look exactly — do not upgrade a casual snap into a polished studio shot, and do not downgrade a polished shot either. Faces rendered accurately and naturally, hands with five fingers and natural anatomy, no duplicate subjects, no extra limbs, no warped hands, no visible rendering artifacts, no beauty-filter smoothing unless Image 1 already has it.`;
